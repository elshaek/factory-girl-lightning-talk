# Factory Girl Gem
- Create templates of _valid_ objects to be used during testing
- Keep object creation _flexible_
- Customization when instantiating objects
- Used in place of fixtures

* Fixtures: predefined sample data used for testing; 
            independent of database; 
            written in YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language).


## Factories vs Fixtures

#####With fixtures...
```ruby
# users.yaml
marko:
  first_name: Marko
  last_name: Anastasov
  phone: 555-123-6788
```
used in test:
```ruby
describe User do
  it "has a first name" do
    user = users(:marko)
    user.first_name.should eql("Marko")
  end
end
```
- How was user set up?
- What are the correct values to test for? (Have to refer back to predefined data set)

These are usually addressed by writing comments in test code:
```ruby
describe "#show" do
  before do
    # User with preferences to view posts about kittens
    # and in the group with special access to Burmese cats
    # with 4 friends that like ridgeback dogs.
    @user = users(:kitten_fan)
  end
end
```

#####With factories...
```ruby
# spec/factories/user.rb
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :user do
    first_name "Andy"
    last_name  "Lindeman"
    phone "555-123-6788"
  end
end
```
used in test:
```ruby
describe User do
  it "has a first name" do
    user = create(:user, first_name: "Marko", last_name: "Anastasov", phone: "555-123-6788")
    user.first_name.should eql("Marko")
  end
end
```
- We know how user is set up
- Can generate an instance and test it without having to remember details of predefined data
- Note: build vs create
    + Using FactoryGirl.build(:factory_name) does not persist to the db and does not call save!, so your ActiveRecord validations will not run. This is much faster, but validations might be important.
    + Using FactoryGirl.create(:factory_name) will persist to the db and will call ActiveRecord validations. This is obviously slower but can catch validation errors (if you care about them in your tests).
